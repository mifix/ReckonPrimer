ReckonPrimer is an XO activity covering introduction and exercising of the four basic arithmetic
operations. The pedagogical structure follows from long-lasting experiences in didactics of primary
education at Austrian schools. The software will be developed under the internationalization and
localization policies suggested by Sugar Labs. In particular, local variants of operations (eg.
division in English speaking countries versus division in German speaking countries etc) will be
respected.

The software establishes elaborated sequences of learning situations, leading from simple calculations
by heart to the final operations as written by hand. All e-learning situations are supported by
immediate feedback. Summative assessment enables allows coaching (even in distance learning) and
advice on how to proceed in the sequence of learning situations. There will be a clear-cut interface
to diagnosis and special treatment for dyscalculia.

The mode of exercises can be chosen as biased towards self-monitoring (the learner knows her or his
position in the learning sequence), towards competition, towards cooperation or games. Cooperative and
game-oriented modes address international teams, where each participant is represented by his or her
name, the nationality and possibly by his or her mother tongue (see below).

ReckonPrimer allows to combine early language learning with all the exercises implemented: the numbers
involved in the exercises are the same all over the world, and the software relates the numbers with
the respective words recorded in any language via headphones of the XO-hardware .
